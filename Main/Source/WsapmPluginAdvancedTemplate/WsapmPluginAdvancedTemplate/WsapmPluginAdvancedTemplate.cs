// This is a template for an advanced plugin for Windows Server Advanced Power Management (WSAPM)
//
//
// Instructions:
//
//  -   If the reference to Wsapm.Extensions.dll can't be found, WSAPM is probably not installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Server Advanced Power Management\
//      In this case, remove the reference to Wsapm.Extensions.dll and add it again with the DLL located in the install folder of WSAPM.
//
//  -   Add your plugin's information in the WsapmPlugin attribute. Most important is to replace "{YOUR-GUID-HERE}" by a real GUID.
//      To generate a new GUID in Visual Studio, use the Create GUID utility (Tools > Create GUID)
//
//  -   This project targets the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. This is the profile which is needed by WSAPM and is installed during its setup.
//      If you know the installed framework version on the target machine, you could also target another framework version.
//
//  -   Implement your plugin's logic in the overridden methods below. See the descriptions of the single methods.
//
//  -   When finished, pack your plugin DLL, the plugin manifest and all needed DLLs/resources/ReadMe files from the project's output folder in a ZIP file.
//      Do NOT include the Wsapm.Extensions.dll nor the de\Wsapm.Extensions.resources.dll in your package (these files are included in the WSAPM installation)!
//
//  -   Now you can ship your plugin!
//      To install it, go to WSAPM Settings > Plugins > Install plugin and follow the instructions.
